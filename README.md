# Molbox Data

A data repository for [molbox.yamlab.app](https://molbox.yamlab.app) web application.

This repository serves as a demonstration of how Molbox can efficiently read and visualize molecular data derived from computational chemistry calculations hosted on GitHub. The data includes molecular structures, properties, and computational results.

## Available Molecules

- [Caffeine](caffeine/README.md) - C₈H₁₀N₄O₂, a stimulant compound found in coffee and tea
- [Water](water/README.md) - H₂O, the most essential molecule for life

## Usage

Visit [molbox.yamlab.app](https://molbox.yamlab.app) and navigate to this repository to explore the molecular visualizations and data.

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute by adding more molecular data following the structure demonstrated in the existing examples.
